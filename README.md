# Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Project
This project showcases my ability to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data to uncover meaningful insights. Using analytical tools such as Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, I explored real-world datasets, identified patterns and trends, and presented data-driven recommendations.

The dashboard shows that product distribution is fairly even across six countries, with Australia having the highest count. Monthly sales in 2022 fluctuate, starting high in January, dropping in February–April, and rising again in June. The most shipped product is 50% Dark Bites, followed by other popular chocolate varieties. The waterfall chart explains that revenue decreased from January to February due to declines in several product categories, despite some positive contributions.

The chart compares monthly sales from 2018 to 2021 across three categories—Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology. All categories show noticeable fluctuations throughout the year, with peak sales typically occurring in March, September, and December. Technology and Office Supplies often experience the highest spikes, especially in 2021, while Furniture shows moderate but steady growth over the years. Overall, sales trends vary by both month and category, with 2021 generally showing stronger performance.

The map displays sales distribution across the United States using colored circles, where larger and darker circles represent higher sales. Major sales concentrations appear in states like California, Washington, and New York, while most other states show moderate to low sales. Filters on the right allow users to view sales by sub-category, state, and product category.

The chart summarizes sales performance across three main categories—Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology—broken down by sub-categories. Technology shows the highest sales overall, driven mainly by Phones and Accessories, while Furniture performs strongly in Chairs and Tables. Office Supplies has moderate sales, with Binders, Storage, and Paper leading. Profit varies by sub-category, indicated by the color scale, where greener bars represent higher profitability and yellow/orange shades reflect lower profit levels.

This dashboard provides an overview of sales performance across the United States, showing geographic sales distribution on the map, monthly sales trends from 2018 to 2021, and category-wise sales by sub-category. Technology consistently leads in sales, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies, with Phones, Chairs, and Binders among the top-performing sub-categories. The map highlights states with higher sales using darker green markers, while the monthly line charts reveal seasonal peaks—especially noticeable in November and December across all categories.

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support informed decision-making and improve business outcomes. By applying a structured analytical process— from data collection and cleaning to visualization and interpretation— I was able to uncover key findings and provide meaningful recommendations. The project highlights my ability to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights and reinforces the value of data analytics in solving real-world problems.
